If you would like to support this project, you may donate to our equipment fund via paypal:  [![](http://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=teamwii64%40gmail%2ecom&item_name=Team%20Wii64%20Equipment%20Fund&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8)

Please note that while this fund is intended to provide us with a few tools that will aid in the project's development, it will likely not speed up the initial release of WiiSX, as we are working on the project in our free time.
