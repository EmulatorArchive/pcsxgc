A port of the PS1 emulator, PCSX, to the Nintendo GC/Wii

PCSX for GC/Wii by the people who brought you Mupen64GC/Wii64.

If you would like to support this project, you may donate to our equipment fund via paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=teamwii64%40gmail%2ecom&item_name=Team%20Wii64%20Equipment%20Fund&no_shipping=0&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=US&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&charset=UTF%2d8

Please note that while this fund is intended to provide us with a few tools that will aid in the project's development, it will likely not speed up the initial release of WiiSX, as we are working on the project in our free time.
